For the last ten years I've been a managing director of an Italian restaurant Monterosso.  From time to time I am trying to change my profession. Food and Beverage industry is so traditional industry, that you can create some features but the idea is still the same. I have finished JavaGuru Java level one and level two.  In 2019 I have applied through “Mācības pieaugušajiem” for Agile courses. IT was a hobby for me almost all my life. I made some basic webpages, I used to program in Pascal in secondary school. Now I am responsible also for all the IT at restaurant. We have even made our own digital [menu]( Wine list). Guests can see full description, photo and all the allergic. Wine card also has all the information about the wine – year, grape, region and also several sentences from the best sommeliers. 
For my hobbies I would say at this moment it is more about cycling. But before that when in 2016 I was 30kg heavier I started running. To this date completed more than 20 half-marathons, one marathon. Also once I completed the Ironman 70.3. 
After finishing this course I will go as hard as I can to make a switch  to a different industry. It will be even more challenging for me as I will make a step from the leading role to a lower position.
